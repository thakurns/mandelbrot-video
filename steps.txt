I want to create a frame rendering app. This will render 60 frames for second. 
Mandelbrot set image will get zoomed by litte bit for every frame.
I want to create a minute video, which would consits of 60 seconds * 60 frames per second frames.(3600 frames.)

Brain storming questions.
How to reduce the borders for each frame?
How much to reduce the borders for each frame?
Could with default image size, will it take more space for 3600 frames?
If yes how to reduce the image size?
How to use threads here? Do we need to calculate each frame into threads or we need to create a thread for an
image?

After concatenating 3600 frames, how can we make sure that it plays only 60 frames for second?
Does it create a continous moving into illusion? How to make sure it happens?
